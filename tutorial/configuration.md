# Steps to Setup Frappe for Development

To build the Library Management System (LMS) with Frappe, you first need to set up a development environment. Follow the steps below to install the required software and tools.

### Step 1: Update System Packages

Start by updating your package list and upgrading all installed packages to their latest versions:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

### Step 2: Install Python and Pip
Frappe requires Python 3.8 or later. Install Python and its package manager, pip:
```bash
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-setuptools python3-pip
```

### Step 3: Install Node.js
Node.js is needed for building and running JavaScript components of Frappe. Install Node.js (version 14.x):
```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

### Step 4: Install Redis
Redis is used for caching and real-time updates in Frappe. Install it using:
```bash
sudo apt install redis-server
```

### Step 5: Install MariaDB
MariaDB serves as the database server for Frappe. Install it and configure it:
```bash
sudo apt install mariadb-server
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the MariaDB root password and remove insecure defaults.

### Step 6: Install Nginx
Nginx can be used to serve your Frappe application. Install it with:
```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```

### Step 7: Install Bench (Frappe CLI)
Bench is a command-line tool to manage Frappe applications. Install it globally using pip:
```bash
sudo pip3 install frappe-bench
```

### Step 8: Initialize Bench
Create a new Frappe bench folder to set up the development environment:
```bash
bench init frappe-bench --frappe-branch version-14
cd frappe-bench
```

### Step 9: Create a New Frappe Site
Create a new Frappe site named lms.local:
```bash
bench new-site lms.local
```

This will create the site and set up the necessary database tables.

### Step 10: Start Frappe
Start the Frappe development server:
```bash
bench start
```

### Step 11: Configure Hosts File (Optional)
To make the site accessible via lms.local, edit your hosts file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
Add the following line:
```bash
127.0.0.1 lms.local
```

Now you can access your Frappe site by visiting http://lms.local:8000 in your web browser.

## Summary

You have now set up the Frappe development environment and created a new site for your Library Management System (LMS) project. With Frappe and all dependencies installed, youâ€™re ready to start developing features like user roles, dashboards, forms, and more for your LMS.

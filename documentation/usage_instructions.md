# Usage Instructions for the Library Management System (LMS)

This section provides detailed instructions on how to use the Library Management System (LMS). It covers the key features, such as managing books and users, and navigating the system's dashboards.

## Concept Overview

The Library Management System (LMS) is designed with two primary user roles in mind:

- **Librarian**: The librarian has full access to the system, allowing them to manage the entire library digitally. This includes adding books, issuing them through transactions, and creating library members. Essentially, the librarian is the central figure in the LMS, responsible for maintaining the digital structure of the library.

- **Library Member**: A library member has a more limited role, with the primary ability being to view the books available in the library. The system is currently designed to focus more on backend processes, making it easy for librarians to manage the library.

As of now, the app is more backend-focused, giving the librarian all the access and an easy-to-manage digital setup of the library.

> **Future Enhancements (Coming Soon):**
> - [ ] Ability for library members to issue a book by filling out a form.
> - [ ] Ability for the librarian to keep records of where books are physically located in the library, making it visible to members who fill the form to issue it.
> - [ ] Automatic fine calculation for late returns.
> - [ ] Ability for non-library members to fill out a request form to become a library member.

## Librarian: Accessing the Desk

After logging in, the librarian has two options:

1. **Browse as a Library Member**: The librarian can browse the library like any regular member. However, there are limited actions they can perform in this mode.

2. **Switch to Desk Mode**: To utilize their full capabilities, the librarian must switch to Desk mode. This can be done by:
   - Clicking on the hamburger menu icon in the top right.
   - Clicking on the profile photo.
   - Selecting "Switch to Desk".

Once in Desk mode, the librarian can access the following key features:
- Adding books (articles, journals, etc.)
- Issuing books through transactions
- Creating library members

These options will be discussed in detail in the next lesson.

## Library Member: Browsing the Library

When the librarian is in the web app (not in Desk mode), they can only browse the books available, similar to a regular library member. The details of how to browse the library and view available books will be covered in the next lesson.
